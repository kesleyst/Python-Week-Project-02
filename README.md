In this project, we created a code that retrieves stock values by accessing the stock exchange through Yahoo Finance. By entering the stock name and the entry and exit dates, it sends an automatic email to the desired recipient.
*Please note that the commands for automatic sending were based on my laptop screen, so it will be necessary to adjust some values to ensure everything works properly.*
